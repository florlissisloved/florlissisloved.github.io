<p> Hey Flor, I'm sure you remember me, Dan, and how you have been my major crush for almost 2 years now. To me, that's insane, but you haven't just been a crush to me. You've meant so much more to me. Even while we've had our differences, you have been an inspiration beyond my wildest dreams. You've stood up for what you believe in, and even when you haven't felt your best, you stayed strong. You've most likely saved my life more than once, when I wasn't feeling all that great, and now it's my turn to repay this debt. You already know that I'm in love with you, but that's not the reason I made this website. I made it to remind you of all the wonderful things you've done, for tons of people. You're a very loyal friend, you're realistic, and you show people that you can still make it through no matter what. You mean so much to me and a lot of other people, and I'd be more than glad to help you however and whenever you want. You deserve it. You've helped people more than enough, it's our turn to help you. I hope that even when you have your worse days, you can come back to this and remember that there are people that love and care about you endlessly. So many of us love you.</p>

<p>I hope this helped, Flor</p>
